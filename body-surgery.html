                                    <b> Tumescent liposuction </b> describes a “wetting solution” with a local

                                    injected before surgery, causing blood vessels to shrink down or constrict.
                                    This allows liposuction to be performed with the patient under local
                                    anesthesia, minimizes blood loss and reduces postsurgical pain and bleeding.

                                    piece that helps to loosen and melt fat, enabling a greater volume of fat to

                            <h5>Body contouring after massive weight loss</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A body lift procedure smoothens and tightens the skin and underlying tissues and
                                    removes unwanted pockets of fat to eliminate loose skin.</li>
                                <li>The most common reason for a body lift is not aging, but rather skin that cannot
                                    conform to body contours because of weight lossdue to bariatric surgery, dieting,
                                    liposuction or other body-shape changes.&nbsp;</li>
                                <li>For most patients, the underlying issue is not fat, but rather excess skin.&nbsp;
                                </li>
                                <li>During a body lift your plastic surgeon reshapes your body contours by reducing fat;
                                    lifting, tightening and shaping the underlying skin matrix; and smoothing and
                                    reducing the overlying skin.</li>
                                <li>Surgery is typically done under general anesthesia and requires a 1-2 nights stay in
                                    the hospital.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>Thigh lift</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The thighs and hips specifically contain large amounts of the enzyme lipase, which
                                    causes these areas to store fat quickly specially in women. This may be why the
                                    thighs and hips are two areas that seem especially resistant to diet and exercise.
                                </li>
                                <li>A thigh lift is a procedure involves the removal of excess skin and fat from either
                                    the inner or outer thighs. This is often desirable after substantial or bariatric
                                    weight loss or in individuals for whom dieting and exercise have failed to reduce
                                    excess tissue in their thighs.</li>
                                <li>Liposuction may be used as an adjunct to the recontouring of the inner thigh.&nbsp;
                                </li>
                                <li>If you are committed to maintaining a healthy lifestyle and a moderate weight, a
                                    thigh lift can help you regain the youthful thigh contours you desire.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>When to Consider a Thigh Lift</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>If you want your thighs to have a better, more proportional contour and a firmer
                                    look and feel.</li>
                                <li>If you have undergone bariatric surgery or massive weight loss.</li>
                                <li>If you are distressed about loose, flabby skin on your thighs.</li>
                                <li>If you have difficulty fitting into clothing because of heavy thighs.</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Surgery is usually done under general anesthesia, but could be done under spinal
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
