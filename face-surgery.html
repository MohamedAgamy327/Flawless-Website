                                Eye lid surgery (blepharoplasty)
                            </h5>

                            <ul>
                                <li>An eyelid lift, or blepharoplasty, is a surgical procedure to remove skin and to add
                                    or remove fat from the eyelids.&nbsp;</li>
                                <li>The term &ldquo;eyelid lift&rdquo; is a misconception because the eyelid is not
                                    lifted during surgery.</li>
                                <li>Surgery can be performed on either the upper or lower lids, or both.</li>
                                <li>Upper blepharoplasty surgery uses incisions on the skin to allow for removal of skin
                                    and fat. A thin stitch is then used to bring the skin together to allow for a
                                    creation of an eyelid crease.</li>
                                <li>Lower blepharoplasty can involve skin incisions directly below the lash line or an
                                    incision on the inside of the eyelid, called a transconjunctival approach. The
                                    transconjunctival approach allows for access to the eyelid fat without visible
                                    incisions making this technique perfect for patients who need fat removed.&nbsp;
                                </li>
                                <li>The operation can be combined with laser resurfacing of the eyelid skin to reduce
                                    lines and wrinkles.</li>

                                <li>The loss of youthful contours in the face can be due to a variety of factors,
                                    including heredity, gravity, environmental conditions, smoking and stress.</li>
                                <li>A facelift is a surgical procedure that is typically used to give a more youthful
                                    appearance to the face. Technically, it is also called a rhytidectomy. This type of
                                    cosmetic surgery reshapes the lower one-third of the face by removing excess facial
                                    skin. Some facelift procedures also include the tightening of underlying tissues. To
                                    achieve the best result, it is often combined with other additional procedures
                                    addressing the forehead, cheeks, brows and eyes.&nbsp;</li>
                                <li>The procedure could be done under general anesthesia or a sedative through an
                                    intravenous line and local anesthesia to numb your skin.</li>
                                <li>Depending on the degree of skin laxity, the incision is chosen.&nbsp;</li>
                                <li>A traditional facelift incision often begins in the hairline at the temples,
                                    continues around the ear and ends in the lower scalp. Fat may be sculpted or
                                    redistributed from the face, jowls and neck, and underlying tissue is repositioned,
                                    commonly the deeper layers of the face and the muscles are also lifted. Skin is
                                    redraped over the uplifted contours and excess skin is trimmed away.</li>

                                <strong>- A traditional neck lift incision often begins in the hairline at the level of
                                    the sideburn, continues down and around the ear and ends in the posterior hair. The
                                    tissue underlying the neck skin is repositioned, and commonly the platysma muscle is
                                    tightened. Skin is redraped over the uplifted contours and excess skin is trimmed
                                    away.&nbsp;</strong>

                                    as an outpatient procedure but sometimes requires a 1-night stay in the
                                    hospital.</strong>
                            </div>

                                <strong>- During rhinoplasty, the surgeon makes incisions to access the bones and
                                    cartilage that support the nose. The incisions are usually made inside the nose so
                                    that they are invisible after the surgery. Depending on the desired result, some
                                    bone and cartilage may be removed, or tissue may be added. After the surgeon has
                                    rearranged and reshaped the bone and cartilage, the skin and tissue is redraped over
                                    the structure of the nose.&nbsp;</strong>

                                <li>A body lift procedure smoothens and tightens the skin and underlying tissues and

                                <li>The most common reason for a body lift is not aging, but rather skin that cannot

                                    reducing the overlying skin.</li>
